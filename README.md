# 💀 ZeroSkids

> terminal-based chaos engine for code obfuscation 😭

**ZeroSkids** is a multi-language code obfuscator made for devs who hate readability and love drama. Built for terminal enjoyers who want flashy ASCII, cursed colors, and support for popular languages like:

- 🐍 Python  
- ⚡ JavaScript  
- 🟦 TypeScript  

no fluff. just pure, beautiful, spaghetti code.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Colorful terminal UI w/ built-in ASCII memes  
- 🔀 Multi-language obfuscation (JS, TS, Python)  
- 🧪 Comes with sample files to instantly test  
- 💀 Converts code into unreadable nightmare fuel  
- ⚙️ Easy CLI interface, plug into CI/CD for max trolling  

---

## 🧠 Usage

```bash
python3 src/main.py <file-to-obfuscate>
```

✅ works with \`.py\`, \`.js\`, \`.ts\`  
❌ does not work with clean code enthusiasts

## 📁 Example

### Input (`example.py`)
```python
print("hello world")
```

### Output
```python
exec('\x70\x72\x69\x6e\x74(\x22\x68\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f\x20\x77\x6f\x72\x6c\x64\x22)')
```

no one’s reading that. not even god.
